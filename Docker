DockerFile --(Build)--> DockerImage --(run)--> DockerContainer

DockerFile is what you or developer write code to do something (ex- Install)

Docker Image is you get when you build docker file .

Docker Container is you get when you run your Docker image.

If you have 30 Docker containers that you want to run, you can run them all on a single virtual machine.
To run 30 virtual machines, you’ve got to boot 30 operating systems with at least minimum resource requirements available before
factoring the hypervisor for them to run on with the base OS.
Just assuming you’re going to go with a minimum 256M VM you’d be looking at 7.5G of RAM with 
30 different OS kernels managing resources. 
With Docker you could allocate a chunk of RAM to one VM and have a single OS managing those competing resources… 
and you could do all of that on the base operating system without a costly hypervisor needing to be involved at all.
